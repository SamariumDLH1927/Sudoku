# Sudoku
A strategy of dynamic programming to solve soduku. This strategy is different from usually unumeration algorithm, but closer to human's thinking. It scans the whole sudoku for every possible number in each blank as well as each number's all possible positions, and find the only solution to some blank, and then repeat the process until it find the only solution.
